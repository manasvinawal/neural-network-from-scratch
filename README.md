# Neural Network from Scratch (purely using NumPy)

A neural network built **from the ground up using only NumPy**  (no PyTorch, no TensorFlow)

Demonstrates a full understanding of backpropagation, gradient flow, and optimization in deep learning.

**Goal**: Understand the internals of neural networks by building every component manually.

Inspired by *Neural Networks from Scratch* by Sentdex (Harrison Kinsley)

## Results

**96%+ accuracy** on a non-linear spiral dataset  
Full training loop with loss and accuracy tracking  
Manual gradient computation, no autograd

This proves the network **actually learns**, not just compiles.
